## Problem Statement:
Global health outcomes vary widely across regions, influenced by differences in healthcare access, disease prevalence, treatment availability, and socio-economic conditions. Without a clear, data-driven visualization of these factors, policymakers and health organizations struggle to identify priority areas for intervention. This dashboard aims to provide a unified overview of global health indicators to help inform strategic decision-making, allocate resources effectively, and monitor long-term progress in global health improvement.
